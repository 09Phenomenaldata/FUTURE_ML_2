# FUTURE_ML_2

Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn. It is designed to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values and inconsistent data.

Encoding categorical features using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding.

Normalizing and scaling numerical features for model efficiency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of churn vs. non-churn customers.

Correlation analysis to identify important features.

Visualizations to understand customer demographics, tenure, and usage patterns.

Model Building & Training

Implemented multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

ROC Curve and AUC score for overall model performance.

Confusion Matrix to evaluate prediction results.

Insights & Recommendations

Identification of key factors driving churn.

Suggestions for retention strategies based on analysis.

Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Churn_Prediction_Task2.git
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce results.

If you want, I can also prepare a README.md file for GitHub** with headings, badges, and screenshots of your notebook results so it looks visually appealing. That way, your repo will look more professional to recruiters and collaborators.
